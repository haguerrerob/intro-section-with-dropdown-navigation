# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## My process

### Built with

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

We worked on this challenge presented by FrontEndMentor. To solve it, we have used Svelte (SvelteKit) together with Tailwindcss. We have divided the problem into multiple reactive components, controlled by index.svelte. The application has been developed keeping in mind the mobile-first workflow philosophy. This way we achieved a responsive solution that adapts to different device sizes. The biggest achievement was to use tailwindcss as a tool to give the final styles and learn how to configure this tool globally. The use of Sveltekit allows us to develop a responsive application in a simple way.
